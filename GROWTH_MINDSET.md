## Growth Mindset

A _growth mindset_ happens when one believes that success can be achieved through perseverance and effort, while a _fixed mindset_ happens when one believes that success only comes from intelligence and inherent talent ([Haffenden, 2015](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset/)). Having a growth mindset will help me reach my full potential and acheive higher goals. To keep myself in a growth mindset, I will do the following:

1. Embrace challenges, and not avoid them.
2. Persist through obstacles, rather than lose focus.
3. Learn from criticism, instead of ignoring it.
4. Be inspired by the success of others, in lieu of viewing it as a threat.
