## Design Webpages with CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used to add style and design to the elements of a webpage. CSS style rules consist of a selector that identifies which HTML element(s) to apply style to, followed by a set of curly brackets. Between the curly brackets we declare one or more style values and properties. A colon goes between the value and property, while a semi-colon goes at the end of each property. Here is [the CSS code](https://deltav-101.mlhauschildt.repl.co/style.css) that I use to teach DeltaV's Code 101 course.
