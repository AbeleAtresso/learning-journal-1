## Coder's Computer
[I ran commands in the terminal](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-prework/prework/) to prepare my computer for coding. I installed VS Code, Git, Node and NPM, ESLint, and more!

- Terminal: An command line app that allows me to interact with my computer's operating system.
- Homebrew: A package manager for Mac OS. It allows me to install free programs through the terminal's command line.
- VS Code: A sophisticated text editor for coding that has a strong following in the web development community. [Other options I could have installed](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) include Atom, Sublime, and many more. 
- Git: Version control software that helps me and my teammates manages changes to code.
- Node and NPM: Node is a Javascript runtime environment. NPM is a package manager for Node. It gives me access to install programs from an online registry. 
- ESLint: A tool that identifies problems found in JavaScript code. It helps me solve code errors and style issues.
- Tree: A command that I can type into the terminal to display a list of all directories and folders in a tree view format.

## Command Line Cheat Sheet
I worked through the [Linux tutorial on Ryans Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) and came up with this cheat sheet.

### Basic Navigation
- `pwd`: Tells you what your current (or present working) directory is. Short for 'print working directory'
- `ls`: Lists the contents of the current directory. Short for 'list'
  - `ls -l`: Displays a long listing of contents
  - `ls [path]`: List the contents of a specific subdirectory instead of the current directory's contents. Using a `/` by itself will reference the root directory. Using a `./` (or omitting this) will reference the current directory. Using `../` will reference the parent directory. Using `~` will reference the home directory
- `cd`: Changes the current directory.
  - `cd [path]`: Move to a specific subdirectory. Using `cd /` will move you to the root directory. Using a `./Directory` (or omitting this) will move in relation to the current directory. Using `cd ../Directory` will move in relation to the parent directory. Using `cd ~` will move you to the home directory. 
  - As you start typing a path you may press the Tab key at any time to invoke an auto complete action.

### More About Files
- `file`: Tells you what type of files something is. Examples include: directory, audio file, images, text file, executable file, etc.
  - `file [path]`: Specify the specific file to reference. Use single or double quotes around path names that have spaces.
- Hidden files: If the file or directory's name begins with a `.` then it is considered to be hidden. To list all contents of a directory, including hidden files use the `ls -a` command.
