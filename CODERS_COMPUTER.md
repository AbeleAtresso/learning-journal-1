## Coder's Computer
[I ran commands in the terminal](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-prework/prework/) to prepare my computer for coding. I installed VS Code, Git, Node and NPM, ESLint, and more!

- Terminal: An command line app that allows me to interact with my computer's operating system.
- Homebrew: A package manager for Mac OS. It allows me to install free programs through the terminal's command line.
- VS Code: A sophisticated text editor for coding that has a strong following in the web development community. [Other options I could have installed](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) include Atom, Sublime, and many more. 
- Git: Version control software that helps me and my teammates manages changes to code.
- Node and NPM: Node is a Javascript runtime environment. NPM is a package manager for Node. It gives me access to install programs from an online registry. 
- ESLint: A tool that identifies problems found in JavaScript code. It helps me solve code errors and style issues.
- Tree: A command that I can type into the terminal to display a list of all directories and folders in a tree view format.
