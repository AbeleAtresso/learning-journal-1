## Structure Webpages with HTML
Hypertext Markup Lanugage (HTML) is a programming lanugage to define the structure and to organize content on a webpage. Most standard HTML elements comprise of an opening and closing tag. Between the tags we put content such as text or other HTML tags. Attributes can be added to opening HTML tags to provide additional information about the tag. Here is [the code](https://repl.it/@mlhauschildt/DeltaV-101) and [the hierarchy](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ecK-waRVLa5_njxA51rhuG5xpDDmlq-TtkarK-nvp0c/edit?usp=sharing) that I use to teach Code DeltaV's Code 101 course.
