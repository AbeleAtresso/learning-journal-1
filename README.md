## About Me

My name is **Marc Hauschildt** and I am a computer science teacher. Between 2004 and 2020 I taught business and computer science classes at [West Liberty High School](https://www.wl.k12.ia.us/). In the spring of 2020 I got hired to teach web and software development at [Kirkwood Community College](https://kirkwood.edu/). I have gone through [DeltaV Code Schoolâ€™s](https://deltavcodeschool.com/) 101-301 classes and now help them teach intro courses in my spare time. I have a wife and two cats and enjoy a variety of social activities with friends and family.

## Growth Mindset

A _growth mindset_ happens when one believes that success can be achieved through perseverance and effort, while a _fixed mindset_ happens when one believes that success only comes from intelligence and inherent talent ([Haffenden, 2015](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset/)). Having a growth mindset will help me reach my full potential and acheive higher goals. To keep myself in a growth mindset, I will do the following:

1. Embrace challenges, and not avoid them.
2. Persist through obstacles, rather than lose focus.
3. Learn from criticism, instead of ignoring it.
4. Be inspired by the success of others, in lieu of viewing it as a threat.
