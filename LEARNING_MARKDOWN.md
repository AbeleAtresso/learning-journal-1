## Learning Markdown

In GitHub, we can create respositories to store and share software application code. Upon creating a repository, we can add markdown (.md) files such as README.md or index.md that will display text on the repo's main page. It is often used as a title page and table of contents for the application. 

Markdown allows us to control the appearance of the text similar to HTML (Hypertext markup language). Instead of using HTML tags, we use markdown syntax. [Wikipedia's Markdown page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example) provides an example of how text is viewed in the browser when using Markdown and HTML. While they produce the same output, there are differences.
