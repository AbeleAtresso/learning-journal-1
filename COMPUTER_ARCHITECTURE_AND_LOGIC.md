## Computer Architecture and Logic
I watched [6 YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAx_6-wdslM&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-) about how computers work. My top 3 most significant learnings are

### What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
All computers need to take input, store information, process it, and output the results. 

### Binary and Data
Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry information as a series of 1s and 0s, called binary. Any number can be represented in binary with only 1s and 0s, the electrical wires deliver these digits as On/Off. A single 1 or 0 is called a bit, while 8 bits is called a byte. A byte can store any number between 0-255. Four bytes (32 bits) can store over 4 billion numbers. Text, images, videos and sound can also be represented with numbers.  

### Circuits and Logic
Computers use millions of microscopic electronic components to modify and combine input signals. Together these components form circuits. The circuits inside computers are way faster than a human's ability to perform calculations. Smaller computers are faster because there is less distance for the electrical signal to travel. Because electricity travels at the speed of light, modern circuits can perform billions of calculations per second.
