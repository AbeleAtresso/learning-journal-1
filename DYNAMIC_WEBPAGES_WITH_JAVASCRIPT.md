## Dynamic Webpages with JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that allows me to write code that instructs the browser how to behave when a user interacts with my app. When the browser reads HTML, the document object model (or DOM) is established. JavaScript and jQuery can be used to access and manipulate the DOM, making the user's experience dynamic and interactive.

- HTML establishes the page content and structure. CSS establishes the presentation and appearance. JavaScript enables behavior and interactivity, enhances usability.
- JavaScript files can go inside their own text file with a .js extension. Inside the HTML we tell the browser when to run the JavaScript code by adding a set of `<script></script>` tags. The script element has an `src` attribute which is used to identify the URL of the script file.
- JavaScript can be added directly between the script tags, however that may cause the page to take longer to load. It's better to keep it in a separate file so it can be used on several pages, rather than one.
- Objects are collections of data that can be manipulated with JavaScript. The whole web page defines the document object. 
- Methods can be called using objects to perform tasks. 
- Parameters are additional pieces of data that are sent to the methods for processing. 
- In `document.write('Hello World');`, **document** is the _object_, **write()** is the _method_, and **'Hello World'** is the _parameter_ that gets sent to the method. Combined together this code prints some text on the web page.
